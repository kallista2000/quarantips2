			<p style="font-size: 18px;"><br>Hello! My name is Jasmin, I am 23 years old and live in Newcastle Upon Tyne with my boyfriend. My flat has been a little small for spending a lot of time in due to lockdown, but I have taken up running to make the most of the time we are allowed outside.<br> We picked up our new puppy Lola last week, she is a black miniature Cockapoo! She is super cute and very tiny. It is nice being able to be at home with her all the time whilst she is still a puppy. I have also taken up knitting during quarantine to help relax and unwind: I am currently working on a scarf for the winter! <br> Another thing that I have managed to do more of whilst being at home more is yoga. I have been waking up earlier in the morning to spend 30 minutes stretching and practicing mindfulness. My favourite yoga videos are <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/yogawithadriene">  Yoga with Adriene </a> <br></p>

		<p style="font-size: 18px;"><br>Hey my name is Jessica, i’m 23 years old and I live in london. During quarantine i’ve been staying busy and proactive. I’ve finally got back into fine art and illustrations - I feel expressing my creativity is a great outlet during these uncertain times. I’ve also had time to practice mediation and yoga which I think has been super beneficial not only for my physical health but also my mental health. This pandemic has put a lot of things into perspective in a lot of ways for a lot of people. Keeping in touch with my friends and family has also been a great way of staying grounded and connected. I’ve also taken the time to educate myself on marketing and business info through podcasts, one of my favorite at the moment is <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/5K96ryZCjCmxqMzEotvS8h?si=Lkh-GmdLQsSax41gdRmPPA"> “The Futur”: </a> </p>

		<p style="font-size: 18px;"><br>Hi! My name is Kallista, I am 19 years old and I live in Yorkshire with my parents and 2 brothers, however usually I live in Leeds which is where I go to university. One of my favourite things to do in lockdown is reading a book in the garden with a cold beer, I also like to stay active by doing home workouts or going for walks. Additionally, I have invested in a sewing machine and I am currently teaching myself to alter and repair my old clothes to discourage myself from buying new ones!<br>
		For anyone who is interested in learning to sew, although it may seem daunting there are many informative tutorials on youtube, and I would highly recommend using <a href="https://www.pinterest.co.uk/search/pins/?rs=ac&len=2&q=sewing%20projects%20for%20beginners&eq=Sewing&etslf=4131&term_meta[]=sewing%20projects%20for%20beginners%7Cautocomplete%7C6"> Pinterest </a> for inspiration. <br>
